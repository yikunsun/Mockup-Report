# Guest Satisfaction Report on Net Promoter Score
**Guest satisfaction highly matters in every industry, especially in hospitality industry. Satisfied guests are loyal to our brand. They bring their family and 
friends to become our patrons, which further improves the financial results. We call this type of customers promoter. On the other hand, dissatisfied guests might tarnish a brand's reputation by spreading negative
word of mouth, so the potential customers might choose to stay away from the brand due to the bad reviews. This type of customers are called detractor because they damage
a brand's value.**

**So how do we tell if our brand has more promoters or detractors? Here comes a metric called Net Promoter Score, which is equal to % of Promoters - % of Detractors. For example, 
if we have 100 customers in total, 60 of them are promoters, while 20 of them are detractors, then our NPS (Net Promoter Score) = 60%-20% = 40%. Based on 40%, how do we tell if
it's a good score or not? A good NPS varies among industries. In some industries, an NPS of 15% is good, while in other industries, this score might be far lower than the average.
Brands with brilliant NPS usually tend to grow faster and observe better financial performance than those with the average or poor scores.**

**As a Guest Services Analyst in the hospitality industry, I need to make sure all the properties owned by our brand have a healthy NPS. If any property observes a negative 
trend of NPS, I will also need to investigate areas that cause dissatisfaction.**

**In order to help the leadership understand each property's level of guest satisfaction and to identify any negative trends of NPS, I designed this Guest Satisfaction Report
with visualizations. All the property names and data are mock for confidentiality.**

Hope you like the design of this mock report. Thank you!
